    <h2>CONVERSATIONAL HINTS FOR YOUNG SHOOTERS.</h2>

    <p>LUNCH (<i>continued</i>).&mdash;Perhaps the best piece of
    advice that I can give you, my young friend, is that&mdash;for
    conversational purposes&mdash;you should make a careful study
    of the natures and temperaments of your companions. Watch their
    little peculiarities, both of manner and of shooting; pick up
    what you can about their careers in sport and in the general
    world, and use the knowledge so acquired with tact and
    discretion when you are talking to them. For instance, if one
    of the party is a celebrated shot, who has done some
    astonishing record at driven grouse, you may, after the
    necessary preliminaries, ask him to be good enough to tell you
    what was the precise number of birds he shot on that occasion.
    Tell him, if you like, that the question arose the other day
    during a discussion on the three finest game-shots of the
    world. If you happen to know that he shot eighteen hundred
    birds, you can say that most people fixed the figure at fifteen
    hundred. He will then say,&mdash;"Ah, I know most people seem
    to have got that notion&mdash;I don't know why. As a matter of
    fact, I managed to get eighteen hundred and two, and they
    picked up twenty-two on the following morning." Your obvious
    remark is, "By Jove!" (with a strong emphasis on the "by")
    "what magnificent shooting!" After that, the thing runs along
    of its own accord. With a bad shot your method is, of course,
    quite different. For example:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Young Shot</i>. I must say I like the old style of
        walking up your birds better than driving, especially in a
        country like this. I never saw such difficult birds as we
        had this morning. You seemed to have the worst of the luck
        everywhere.</p>

        <p><i>Bad Shot</i>. Yes&mdash;they didn't come my way much.
        But I don't get much practice at this kind of
        thing&mdash;and a man's no good without practice.</p>

        <p><i>Y.S.</i> That was a deuced long shot, all the same,
        that you polished off in the last drive. When I saw him
        coming at about a hundred miles an hour, I thanked my stars
        he wasn't my bird. What a thump he fell!</p>

        <p><i>B.S.</i> Oh, he was a fairly easy shot, though a bit
        far off. I daresay I should do well enough if I only got
        more shooting. I'm not shooting with my own gun, though.
        It's one of my brother's, and it's rather short in the
        stock for me.</p>
    </div>

    <p>That starts you comfortably with the Bad Shot. You soothe
    his ruffled vanity, and give him a better appetite for
    lunch.</p>

    <p>Now, besides the Good Shot, and the Bad Shot&mdash;the two
    extremes, as it were, of the line of shooters&mdash;you might
    subdivide your sportsmen further into&mdash;</p>

    <p>(1.) <i>The Jovial Shot.</i> This party is on excellent
    terms with himself and with everybody else. Generally he shoots
    fairly well, but there is a rollicking air about him, which
    disarms criticism, even when he shoots badly. He knows
    everybody, and talks of most people by nick-names. His sporting
    anecdotes may be counted upon for, at any rate, a <i>succès
    d'estime</i>. "I never laughed so much in my life," he begins,
    "as I did last Tuesday. There were four of us&mdash;Old SANDY,
    BUTCHER BILL, DICK WHORTLEBURY, and myself. SANDY was driving
    us back from Dillwater Hall&mdash;you know, old PUFFINGTON's
    place&mdash;where we'd been dining. Devilish dark night it was,
    and SANDY's as blind as a bat. When we got to the Devil's
    Punchbowl I knew there'd be some warm games, 'cos the horse
    started off full tilt, and, before you could say knife, over we
    went. I pitched, head first, into DICK's stomach, and SANDY and
    BILL went howling down like a right and left of rabbits. Lord,
    I laughed till the tears ran down my face. No bones broken, but
    the old BUTCHER's face got a shade the worst of it with a
    thorn-bush on the slope. Cart smashed into matchwood, of
    course."</p>

    <p>(2.) <i>The Dressy Shot.</i> Wonderful in the boot,
    stocking, and gaiter department. Very tasteful, too, in the
    matter of caps and ties. May be flattered by an inquiry as to
    where he got his gaiters, and if they are an idea of his own.
    Sometimes bursts out into a belt covered with silver clasps.
    Fancy waistcoats a speciality. His smoking-suit, in the
    evening, is a dream of gorgeous rainbows. Is sometimes a very
    fair shot. Generally wears gloves, and a fair moustache.</p>

    <p>(3.) <i>The Bored Shot.</i> A good sportsman, who says he
    doesn't care about sport. Often has literary tastes. Has views
    of his own, and is, consequently, looked upon as a rather
    dangerous idealist by honest country gentlemen, who confine
    their reading to an occasional peep at the <i>Times</i>, and an
    intimate quoting acquaintance with the novels of Mr. SURTEES.
    Often shocks his companions by telling them he really doesn't
    care much about killing things, and would just as soon let them
    off. However, he shows a perfectly proper anger if he misses
    frequently. Is not unlikely to be an authority on sheep and
    oxen, and may, perhaps, be accepted as the Conservative
    Candidate for his County division, dumb but indignant County
    magnates finding that he expresses their views better than they
    can do it themselves. Don't talk to him about sport. Try him
    with books, interesting articles in the Magazines, and so
    forth.</p>

    <p>(4.) <i>The Soldier Shot.</i> This kind is generally a
    Captain, dresses well, but not gaudily, and smokes big cigars.
    There seems to be a general idea that a man who can teach
    privates to shoot targets must be able to shoot game himself.
    Yet the Soldier Shot misses birds quite beautifully. He will
    have often shot big game in India with an accuracy that
    increases in proportion to the number of miles that separate
    him from the scene of his exploits. After all, the ability to
    "brown" a herd of elephants does not guarantee rights and lefts
    at partridges. Apt to declaim tersely and forcibly about the
    hardships of a military career.</p>

    <p>(5.) <i>The Average Shot.</i> Talk to him about average
    matters, unless you hear he is a celebrity in some other branch
    of sport. In that case, get details from him of his last Alpine
    climb, or his latest run to hounds, or ask his views on racing
    matters. Most average shots go racing, and think they
    understand all about it.</p>

    <p>I say nothing here about the Dangerous Shot, because it is
    never right to get within talking distance of him. In fact, he
    ought not to be talked to at all. I am not sure he ought to be
    allowed to live. Still, his exploits furnish material for many
    an animated conversation amongst the survivors.</p>

        <p><i>Police Inspector.</i> Now, my good friends, I am
        going to be as polite as possible, but I must obey the
        regulations of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Works and
        Public Buildings. And I say you cannot speak, because you
        have not given proper notice to the authorities.</p>

        to the Commissioner four days ago.</p>

        <p><i>Pol. In.</i> Oh, did you? Then that of course alters
        the case. What are you, Sir?</p>

        <p><i>First Or.</i> I am the "Friends of the Horny Hands of

        <p><i>Pol. In.</i> (<i>after referring to note-book</i>).
        Ah, I <i>thought</i> I was right. Your application came in
        second, Sir&mdash;the "Decayed Washerwomen" got in before
        you. Look here. (<i>Pointing out regulation.</i>) "Not more
        than one Meeting shall be allowed at the same time, and if
        notices of two or more Meetings are given for the same day,
        preference shall be given to that Meeting of which notice

        not in it. Better luck next time. There is another Bank

    <p>THE GOOD OLD (SUNDAY) TIMES REVIVED.&mdash;The specimen
    number of <i>The Sunday Times</i> as it was at its commencement
    in 1822, given on Sunday, October 23rd, 1892, is most
    interesting. Theatrical advertising was quite "a feature" at
    that time, when only two Theatres, Drury Lane and Covent
    Garden, seem to have advertised. The names there are of EDMUND
    KEAN simply as Mr. KEAN, of Messrs. DOWTON, HARLEY, YOUNG,
    MUNDEN, Mrs. GLOVER, and of Madame VESTRIS as <i>Ophelia</i>.
    BRAHAM is there, as also LISTON and Miss STEPHENS. Prize Fights
    are done in the good old Tom-and-Jerry style, and the Police
    Reports are made so amusing as to suggest that such a light
    touch as is occasionally given in the "Day by Day" of the
    <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, might be nowadays welcome in (Police)
    Court News. Altogether, a happy thought to reproduce the
    <i>Sunday Times</i> of 1822, and may the <i>Sunday Times</i> of
    1892 live up to it, and be "going strong" in 1992!
    <i>Prosit!</i></p>

    <p>The proceedings of the Midnight Mass Meeting of Unemployed
    Guys at Vauxhall on the fifth of November were of a somewhat
    disorderly nature, several of the speeches being characterised
    by a distinctly incendiary tone, as will be seen from the
    following account by <i>Mr. Punch's</i> Special Reporter, who
    was present throughout.</p>

    <p>The Chair-guy (whose appearance was comparatively
    respectable) said he was proud to occupy the
    chair&mdash;notwithstanding that the bottom was out of it.
    (<i>Shame!</i>) Oh. he was used to that, although he could tell
    the meeting he had driven his own donkey-cart once upon a time,
    if he had come down to a wheelbarrow now! (<i>Cries of "Toff!"
    and "Aristocrat!" from the more extreme Guys.</i>) He did not
    understand those expressions of disapproval&mdash;a wheelbarrow
    with one leg missing was surely an unostentatious conveyance
    enough. Well, they had met that evening to discuss the means to
    be taken to obviate the depression in the important branch of
    out-door industry in which, if he did not mistake, they were
    all interested. (<i>Hear, hear!</i>) That such depression
    existed, and was on the increase, there was, unhappily, no
    doubt&mdash;it was becoming more and more difficult, as they
    knew without his telling them, for the steadiest Guy to
    maintain himself in a proper position, without extraneous
    support. He knew, for a fact, that there were hundreds of Guys
    at that very moment who, when their present job was over, would
    find themselves&mdash;through no fault of their
    own&mdash;thrown out of employment for another twelvemonth, at
    least. Did they call <i>that</i> justice? (<i>No! and
    groans.</i>) The whole system was iniquitous&mdash;the question
    was, how they were to put a stop to it. He invited suggestions
    from the Audience.</p>

    <p>A Guy said that, in his opinion, their decline was entirely
    due to their inability to supply themselves with the apparel
    necessary and suitable to their calling. What were their
    duties? Why, to keep alive the memory of their famous Founder,
    the author of the great, and never-to-be-forgotten Gunpowder
    Plot&mdash;he need hardly say he alluded to GUIDO FAWKES!
    (<i>Enthusiastic and prolonged cheering.</i>) He was no scholar
    himself&mdash;he had never enjoyed a University
    education&mdash;and he did not pretend to be an authority on
    historical costume. Still, he felt safe in asserting that a Guy
    who, like himself, was compelled to represent their glorious
    Predecessor in an old tail coat, a pair of baggy tweed
    trousers, and a pot hat with a hole through the crown, did so
    under a cruel disadvantage. He had heard that, in former times,
    every Guy was sent out provided, as a matter of course, with a
    dark lantern and a box of matches. Who ever saw a Guy so
    equipped nowadays? They had been robbed of the very implements
    of their trade by the grasping greed of their so-called
    superiors. (<i>Shame!</i>) In his opinion every Guy had a right
    to be furnished with the correct costume of the
    period&mdash;whatever that might be&mdash;at the public
    expense. (<i>Loud cheers.</i>)</p>

    <p>A Guy in a Cocked Hat said he did not think the previous
    speaker had mentioned the real cause of their fallen
    fortunes&mdash;their <i>clothes</i> were right enough; they had
    to thank their own shortsighted policy for their present
    position&mdash;yes, he was there to speak plainly, as Guy to
    Guy, and he told them that it was nothing short of social
    suicide for a Guy to carry about a placard, such as he saw too
    many of them wearing that evening, inscribed with the name of a
    recent murderer or some other popular but ephemeral favourite.
    (<i>Some murmuring.</i>) <i>That</i> was not the way to
    preserve the name and fame of their revered Chief. No; let
    every Guy be true to himself and his order, let him indignantly
    refuse to sully his descent by such vulgar and unworthy
    devices, and then&mdash;(<i>Uproar, amidst which the Speaker
    was compelled to resume his seat.</i>)</p>

    <p>A Guy in a Blue Mask, who carried a placard bearing the name
    of the Ex-Premier, described the remarks of both his brother
    Guys as pestilent drivel. It was not clothes that made the Guy.
    A Guy was a Guy in any guise! (<i>Loud cheers.</i>) But no Guy
    ever rose in the world yet without combustibles of some sort
    inside him, and how many of them ever knew what it was to get
    their fill of crackers? They were starving amidst an abundance
    of squibs! Society was responsible, and must be forced to do
    its duty. He had had enough of it, he meant to get a good
    blow-out before he was much older, he could tell them, and if
    the Government refused to provide it free, he must loot a
    firework factory, that was all&mdash;he was ready to lead the
    way&mdash;if they would follow! (<i>Applause.</i>)</p>

    <p>A Guy in a Yellow Mask said he was in favour of proceeding
    by peaceable and constitutional methods if possible. Much could
    be done by organising and bringing their grievances before
    Parliament, with a view to remedial legislation. They might
    begin by agitating for the Franchise. "One Guy, one vote!"
    would be a popular cry just now, when some Electoral Reforms
    were believed to be in contemplation. Fortunately they had a
    Home Secretary whom they might reasonably hope to find
    sympathetic&mdash;he thought they should ascertain his views
    before taking any other steps.</p>

    <p>A Guy in a Pink Mask said he had organised till he was sick
    of it. As for the Home Secretary, he happened to have headed a
    deputation to the Home Office that very afternoon&mdash;and
    what did the Meeting think was the result? Why, the Home
    Secretary had declined to receive him! (<i>Shame!</i>) Ah, he
    might call himself a Radical&mdash;but did he treat a Guy as a
    Man and a Brother? Did he recognise that, creatures of rags and
    shavings as they were, they had their feelings? Not he! they
    were all alike, these politicians, directly they got into
    office. How long, he asked them, were Guys to be chivied, and
    harried, and moved along into back-streets by the brutal
    minions of a corrupt middle-class? If they wanted to get their
    rights, they must make themselves a nuisance to the
    Authorities, like other people. It was all very fine to talk
    about the Franchise, and "One Guy, one vote!" and all the rest
    of it, but they all knew that Home Rule blocked the way at
    present. They must go to Trafalgar Square in their thousands;
    it was the finest place for a bonfire in all London, and they
    had been kept out of it long enough. <i>He</i> meant to go, if
    he had to be carried there! (<i>Loud cheers.</i>)</p>

    <p>A Guy in Spectacles and a Tall Hat, said that a
    demonstration in the Square would, no doubt, be an excellent
    way of drawing public attention to their wrongs. He advised
    that when they had succeeded in capturing the Square, they
    should proceed to pass a resolution calling upon the London
    County Council to find instant and permanent employment for
    such Guys as were out of work. (<i>Cheers.</i>) They could do
    it easily enough if they liked, and he would tell them how. All
    over London, nay, in the very Square itself, there were
    innumerable pedestals at present usurped by Statues which were
    a disgrace to the Metropolis. All the Council had to do was to
    remove those Statues from positions they had so long abused,
    and promote the most deserving and destitute Guys to fill their
    places. (<i>Uproar.</i>)</p>

    <p>A Guy in Fustian and a Red Comforter rose excitedly to
    protest against the last speaker's proposals, which he declared
    were an insult to their common Guyhood. They might have come
    down in the world, but hitherto, whatever might be said of
    them, they had, at least, never rendered themselves publicly
    ridiculous. Now they were asked to degrade themselves by
    accepting the ignominious position of London Statues! Was there
    a Guy who would ever hold up his head again, after such an
    infamous surrender of his self-respect and independence? He
    felt it his duty to denounce the Guy who was guilty of such a
    suggestion as a wolf, in sheep's clothing, a base traitor to
    his order, and a paid spy!</p>

    <p>Thanks to Messrs. SIMS and RALEIGH and the Court Company for
    a good hearty laugh, and many of them at their new three-act
    farcical comedy, <i>The Guardsman</i>. It Raleigh is good, and
    Sims likely to be in for a long run. Therefore, congratulations
    to Mr. CHUDLEIGH, who is in the proud position of "Sole Lessee
    and Manager," of the Court. Odd, as a correspondent remarked in
    a letter to <i>Mr. Punch</i> last week, is the coincidental
    resemblance of the master-motive of the plot to that of
    <i>Incognita</i> at the Lyric; viz., the young man refusing to
    marry the girl with whom he is really in love, because he is in
    love with the very same young lady without knowing her name or
    anything about her. But hath not the old Spanish Comedy-writer,
    GONZALES, used it three times? hath not his fellow-countryman,
    VEGA MORVEGA, used it in his now obsolete play of <i>The
    Distressed Mother</i>? and hath not VODENDOL, the Norwegian
    dramatist, absolutely nauseated us with it, not to mention its
    constant use by that imitation of GOLDONI, Count ERFITO
    D'ALUMINIO? And to come nearer home, did not the
    German&mdash;but why pursue the "motive" until you run it to
    earth, and even then it won't be killed, but will be
    flourishing thousands of years hence, when the New Zealand
    playwright among the ruins of London shall take up his
    note-book and commence a scenario on the old, but to him, quite
    original idea.</p>

    <p>Then, in the last Act of <i>The Guardsman</i>, if we have a
    French room with half-a-dozen doors, leading to half-a-dozen
    different places, with which arrangement not a few of us are
    familiar in pieces brought over fresh from the Palais Royal,
    and occurring in farces of which <i>Bébé</i>, <i>Anglicè
    Betsey</i>, at the Gymnase and Criterion is a type, shall we
    complain? Shall we not rather laugh heartily over the good old
    game of Hide-and-Seek, which on the stage is invariably the
    cause of much amusement to one person for whom, at all events,
    I can answer? What does it matter if to some it recalls a few
    farcical comedies all excellent material? Not a bit! I gather
    from the genuine laughter and applause of the crowded house at
    the Court, that this amuses and will continue to amuse some
    hundreds nightly, as long as it is all done so well, and at
    such high pressure, as it is now in <i>The Guardsman</i>. The
    First Act is good; the Second is the best; but the Third is
    like the last figure in an after-supper early-in-the-morning
    Lancers, ending in a whirligig <i>galop</i>, when everything is
    fast and furious, and just the tune and its measure taken

    this is not his character, how is it he is on such friendly
    terms with the <i>Modiste</i>, carefully played, and with great
    spirit too, by Miss AGNES THOMAS? Mr. ELLIOT is all go and
    bustle; if he were not so, pop would go the piece. The makeup
    of Mr. LITTLE for the old Captain is uncommonly good; it is a
    small part, but, with a LITTLE in it, it is big. Mr. NAMBY, as
    the Irishman, <i>Miles</i>, first-rate; quite <i>Miles
    gloriosus</i>. But I can't go on with praise, they're all so
    good, and ELLALINE TERRISS charming. Miss CAROLINE HILL,
    fresher than the proverbial paint, makes a rattling part of
    <i>Lady Jones</i>, and, as the motto of this Company is that of
    Racing Eights, "Swing, swing together!"&mdash;which might, in
    another sense, have been the refrain sung by a brazen band of
    Highwaymen in the good old times&mdash;it is likely that
    they'll keep the Court-Boat going the pace, with the tide of
    popular favour, for many months to come.</p>

    <p>As a Postscript, I may add a letter on the subject addressed
    to <i>Mr. Punch</i>.</p>

    <p class="author"><i>Oct. 25th.</i></p>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,</p>

    <p>In the admirable letter of "AN OLD SOLDIER" in your paper
    this week, there are a few unimportant errors due, no doubt, to
    your Correspondent's age, and the shortness of memory
    consequent upon it that mar, in a measure, the trenchant force
    of his criticism. I feel sure he will pardon my reminding him
    that the Coldstream Guards do <i>not</i> wear varnished or
    patent-leather boots with a tunic, except in "<i>Levée</i>
    dress;" that Mr. CHARLES WARNER did not play a private soldier
    in "the same distinguished regiment," but in the Grenadiers;
    that a Captain could never, by any possibility be "on guard" at
    the Tower; that the officer on duty at the Tower is called the
    "Picquet," and not the "Orderly" officer, and is never a
    Captain; that no Guardsman has ever, in the memory of man, worn
    a "scarf" in uniform; and that no soldier, worthy of the name,
    considers the mess of his own Battalion "an odd sort of place
    to dine at," even "in the height of the Season."</p>

    <p>I may add that my mother tells me she has often had her
    Court-dress altered on the very morning of the "Drawing-Room."
    With these few trifling exceptions, "AN OLD SOLDIER's" letter
    is most accurate and just.</p>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>O wealthy and world-weary triflers, O idle and
            opulent folk,</p>

            <p>For whom time is a foe to be slain, and life's self
            but a bore or a joke,</p>

            <p>Take yourselves, and your hearts, and your purses to
            Nazareth House and behold</p>

            <p>The brave service of well-bestowed time, the brave
            uses of well-applied gold!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Where is Nazareth House, then, and what? 'Tis in
            Hammersmith, Madam, a place</p>

            <p>That you probably seldom illume with the light of
            your beautiful face.</p>

            <p>But <i>what</i>? That's a far larger question, full
            answer to which would take time.</p>

            <p>Far better go see for yourself. If there's aught of
            the moral sublime</p>

            <p>In these gold-grubbing days, 'tis in scenes where
            love-service unbought and unpaid&mdash;</p>

            <p>A vastly unbusiness-like thing in the eyes of the
            vassals of Trade!&mdash;</p>

            <p>Is devoted in silence unseen to the outcast, the
            old, and the poor.</p>

            <p>Five hundred such waifs are here housed, and <i>they
            yearn to find refuge for more!</i></p>

            <p>That's the pith of the matter, dear Madam! And as
            for the rest, I've returned</p>

            <p>From a visit, and fancy your heart, like my own,
            would have lightened and burned!</p>

            <p>Had you walked through the wards, as I walked, with
            a Sister as frank and unfeigned</p>

            <p>As sweet Charity's servant should be. There was
            nothing o'er piously strained</p>

            <p>In this unrigid Refuge for helplessness. Cheeriness,
            confidence, mirth</p>

            <p>Seemed to reign in these child-crowded
            rooms&mdash;in these wards where the aged, whose
            birth</p>

            <p>Dated well-nigh a century back, whether sewing, or
            smoking, or prone</p>

            <p>On the pallet of sickness, all <i>smiled</i>, and no
            soul seemed forlorn or alone.</p>

            <p>How they sang, those close clustering toddlers,
            their curly heads tier above tier,</p>

            <p>With never a trace of restraint, and unknowing the
            shadow of fear!</p>

            <p>Here timidity checks not the young, and here
            weariness haunts not the old.</p>

            <p>There is laughter on age-shrivelled lips, and the
            eyes of mere babies are bold</p>

            <p>With the confidence born but of love. Even
            imbeciles, helpless and blind,</p>

            <p>Shut out at each sense from full life, yet can feel
            unseen tendance is <i>kind</i>,</p>

            <p>And sit silently placid, or burst into song of a
            heart-searching sort&mdash;</p>

            <p>Muffled speech from unplumbed spirit-depths, yet
            inspired by the impulse of sport.</p>

            <p>Have a chat, my dear Madam&mdash;shrink not, they
            are women!&mdash;with age-wrinkled dames,</p>

            <p>Who are busily bed-quilting here, while the Autumn
            sun ruddily flames</p>

            <p>On the walls from the liberal windows. Bestow but a
            smile and a jest,</p>

            <p>They'll respond with a jest and a smile, for there's
            life in each age-burdened breast,</p>

            <p>And confidence, comfort, and cheer. Here again
            clustered close round the fire</p>

            <p>Are a number of grizzle-look'd men, every one is a
            true "hoary sire,"</p>

            <p>Bowed, time-beaten, grey, yet alert and responsive
            to kindness of speech;</p>

            <p>And see how old eyes can light up if you promise a
            pipe-charge a-piece.</p>

            <p>For the comforting weed KINGSLEY eulogised is not
            taboo in this place,</p>

            <p>Where the whiff aromatic brings not cold reproval to
            Charity's face.</p>

            <p>Ah! the tale is o'erlong for full telling; but never
            a bright afternoon</p>

            <p>In London's chill leaf-strewn October was better
            bestowed. 'Tis a boon</p>

            <p>To be able to speak on behalf of Samaritan kindness
            so schemed,</p>

            <p>In a way in which lovers of man, not of mummeries,
            ever have dreamed.</p>

            <p>On such wise, wide, benevolent lines, with no
            bondage of class or of creed.</p>

            <p>But the helpless Five Hundred still swell, and the
            Sisterhood feel sorest need</p>

            <p>Of enlarging their borders and branches. The
            children especially swarm,</p>

            <p>And for every poor, pale, helpless mite, who can
            here find a pallet and form,</p>

            <p>Home, food, clothing, schooling, life-settlement,
            <i>love</i>, there are hundreds for whom</p>

            <p>And their piteous appeal the response must
            unwillingly come, "No more room!",</p>

            <p>Room, not in their hearts but their wards is this
            unselfish Sisterhood's lack;</p>

            <p>There you, my dear Madam, can help, if your
            purse-strings a little you'll slack.</p>

            <p>The Home for Poor Age, Helpless Childhood, Incurable
            Sickness, depends</p>

            <p>Not on fees or on wealthy endowments, but alms and
            free service of friends.</p>

            <p>Gifts, not only of money, but garments and

    <p>"For graphic touch and keen appreciation of humour, for easy
    conversational narration, give me," quoth the Baron, "the
    papers now being published in <i>Household Words</i> (most
    appropriate place for them), written by MONTAGU WILLIAMS, Q.C.
    and Magistrate." His paper on Ramsgate, telling how he
    travelled down, who his companions were, is as thoroughly
    amusing and interesting as his tribute to the health-giving
    climate of Ramsgate is true. These papers under the
    comprehensive title of "Round London," are to be republished in
    book-form by, as I believe, Messrs. MACMILLAN, and assuredly
    they will be as popular as were the same author's "Leaves" and
    "Later Leaves." False sentiment, MONTAGU WILLIAMS, as man or
    magistrate, does not encourage. "Strongly do I recommend his

    <p>THE OTHER PAPER.&mdash;MR. NEWNES is bringing out a rival to
    the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, Is it to be published before the
    <i>P.M.G.</i>, or later in the day? If the first, its title
    might be <i>The Noon's Paper</i>; if the latter, <i>The
    After-Newnes Paper</i>. Whichever you like, my little dear! Mr.

             alt="'I was that staggered, that I could 'ardly answer him.'" />
        </a>"I was that staggered, that I could 'ardly answer him."
    </div>

    <p>Well, it isn't for one like me to say as how as good luck
    means wirtue rewarded, cos I have, in my long xperiense, seen
    not a werry few cases where it wasn't so&mdash;no, not by no
    manner of means.</p>

    <p>But this I can most trewly say, that my slice of luck during
    this larst munth is worthy of being called a reel staggerer!
    And this is how it cum about:&mdash;</p>

    <p>The Amerrycain Gent, at the Grand Hotel, wanted a change for
    about a weak or two, and he naterally arsked me what he shood
    do. I made lots of wise suggeshons, in course, such as Margate,
    and Grinnidge, and Hern Bay, and other hily arristercratick
    places, but they none on 'em woodn't do. So presently he calls
    out, "Did you ever go to Ireland?" I was that staggered, that I
    coud ardly arnser him; but then I says, "Yes, Sir&mdash;but it
    were sum time ago." Then he staggers me much more wiolently,
    for he says, says he, "Why shoudn't you go with me then, and be
    my Wally!" When I recovered my breth, I says, "I don't know as
    our gentelmanly Manager here woud spare me." So he says, "I'll
    soon see about that." So he rings the bell wiolently, and arsks
    for him&mdash;and he cums&mdash;and, to my serprize, he doesn't
    make not no objecshun at all, which was, in course, werry
    complementary to me, and, strange to say, no more did Mrs.
    ROBERT, when I told her of it.</p>

    <p>Well, I passes over all prelimmenerry derangements, till we
    finds ourselves on board a lovly steemer, bound for Old
    Ireland, as we allus calls her, tho' I don't spose as she's any
    older than the rest on us. It was that ruff that I perposed
    waitin till the sea got smooth; but my Master ony larft, and
    sed I shood be all rite if I follered his adwice, as he was
    used to the sea, and rayther liked it a little ruffish. So he
    got me a sheet of brown paper to put on my manly chest, and
    gave me some champane, and one glass of Perettic Sline, I think
    he called it, and, with their ade, I got over much better than
    I xpected.</p>

    <p>We went as strate as we coud go to the Lakes of Killarny,
    and if that isn't jest about as lovly a plaice as the hole
    world can show, why then let sumbody show me another as is. If
    anyboddy arsked me if it never rained there, truth wood make me
    say yes, it most suttenly does sumtimes, but then so it does
    ewerywheres in ollidy time excep where it's most speshally
    wanted.</p>

    <p>My Guvner's fust harty larf was at dinner on the fust day,
    when he told me to ring for sum pepper. TIM the Waiter arnsered
    the bell, and I told him what was wanted, and I scarce xpecs to
    be bleeved when I says, as he cums back and he says, says he,
    "If you plase, Sir, sure the Pepper's engaged!" I thort the
    Guvner wood ha larfed hisself hill, but he soon recovered, and
    said, "Thin niver mind TIM, we'll do without it to-day, but let
    us have fust turn at it to-morrow." "Suttenly, your honour,"
    says TIM, and wanishes.</p>

    <p>The next day, after driving us round the naybourhood, he
    came in without being arsked, and goes to the fire and warms
    his hands, and then says with a broad grin, "Sure it's a jolly
    lucky cupple as you are, for the rains a bustin down like
    thunder!" When handing the unpeeled Potatows to the Guvner he
    wood pint his finger at one and say, "That's a rale buty,
    Sir!"</p>

    <p>I spose as the Guvner was rayther libberal to TIM, when we
    left, as all reel gennelmen allus is, for the tears acshally
    came into the pore feller's eyes, and he blessed us both, and
    wished as a few more genelman like <i>us</i> woud sumtimes
    wisit poor old Ireland!</p>

    <p>We stayed about a fortnight, but we didn't see another
    Waiter like poor TIM, who was the werry fust humane being as
    hever called me a gennelman, pore feller! but we had a werry
    nice time of it on the hole, which I may p'raps elude to sum
    day, when things ain't quite so brisk as they is just now, and
    I must say as my Guvner behaved like the reel Gennelman as he
    is, when we cum for to settel up.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
